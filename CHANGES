Version 1.0:
+added pdf file processing and displaying on screen
+added most common font recognitions
+added file saving/opening
+added image inserting
+added text inserting
-removed text color picking
-removed font selection (bugged)

BUGS:
-Images can't be deleted, work around is dragging it off the screen, only images present on the screen get saved into the output file.
-Fonts can't be selected, only way is to paste text with the desired font already in it.
-Previously saved files can't be edited, it loses the bounds on the text boxes.
-Font recognition isn't perfect - font sizes and spacing is a bit off and some fonts can't be loaded
-Some images are drawn at incorrect sizes
-Quality loss on save since edited pdf is saved to image first
