TASKS
---------
Task 1) Test text and image deletion.
	Image deletion does not work, workaround is dragging of screen
	which will not get rendered into the file when it is saved into a pdf.

Task 2) Test adding new fonts.
	Failed, fonts can't be changed unless a new font text is copied
	the copy paste buffer and pasted, then it can be changed to save
	the font with the desired text

Task 3) Test loading and saving of pdf
	File saves fine, but text editing of a file previously saved from
	this program, can't be edited again.
	

BUGS
---------
-Images can't be deleted, work around is dragging it off the screen, only images present on the screen get saved into the output file.
-Fonts can't be selected, only way is to paste text with the desired font already in it.
-Previously saved files can't be edited, it loses the bounds on the text boxes.
-Font recognition isn't perfect - font sizes and spacing is a bit off and some fonts can't be loaded
-Quality loss on save since edited pdf is saved to image first


BUGS FIXED
---------
+Images and text added to PDF don't disappear under document
+Scrollbar adjusts to current document
+Text and images are movable/editable again
